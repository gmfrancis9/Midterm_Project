Proposed Architecture:
The website will be developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a Python backend. 
The database will be a SQL database using MySQL and there will be a potential
Search API being used after testing which one will be the best for this application.

Database Schema:
The database will have users which will store their name, username, password, posts, and followers. Another item in the database will be posts. These will have the content of the post
in them as well as the links to the content in the post such as videos and pictures. Additionally there will be scripting in the database to allow for searches to be quick and accurate.

Routes and HTTP Methods:
User Authentication page -- POST, GET personalized feed POST (if refreshed UPDATE Personalized Feed), GET Profile Page --Post, (after posting) UPDATE Personal Feed

Routes and Webpage functionality:
Main Feed -- sign in button (User Authentication) -- Personlized Feed  -- (add post button -- Create Post page,tag video game, hyperlink video game and publisher), 
(my account button -- delete post, archive post, interest list),(other users page -- follow user, unfollow user),
(search button -- search for users and content, search with filters), -- Personalized Feed
